- script to calculate player rating
  - as a general rule, the more games in this current season, the more weight the season has over the previous ones
  - calculate percentage of time played in the last 6 games
- add the prediction confidence (as standard deviation) - uses minutes played
  - missing data from previous seasons doesn't affect the rating, but only the confidence
- add next 1, 3 and 5 fixtures in the report
- combine player rating with the prediction confidence
- based on the final rating and price, what would be the ideal team for the money I've got
- a report of likely players to rise in price if they perform well the next game
- a report of likely players to drop in price if they perform badly the next game
