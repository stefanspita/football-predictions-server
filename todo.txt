- the script getting player fixtures needs to be adjusted if teams skip rounds

- the update script only gets information from the last row
- replace the last6GamesMinutes number with objects like {minutesPlayed, unavailable}
  - if minutesPlayed isn't 0, then unavailable: false
  - if the player is marked as unavailable in the temp file and hasn't played a single minute, then unavailable: true
  - preserve owned status from db

- add validation for update scripts
