- first finish off the player script getting all data for all players ( possibly excluding ones with no points)
- replace the last6GamesMinutes number with objects like {minutesPlayed, injured} // if minutesPlayed isn't 0, then injured is false
- replace the init script with the new script (the init script should only be run at the start of a season)
- the update script only gets information from the last row
- run init script and migrate injuries information already in the db to the new format
   - basically look for missing zeroes in last6GamesMinutes. When something missing, mark the gameweek for that player with injured: true
- only then it's safe to overwrite what's in the db
- update the rest of the scripts to work with the new data shape
